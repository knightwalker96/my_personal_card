In a Flutter project there are mainly 2 types of widgets- 
1. Stateless Widgets     and     2. Stateful Widgets


If a widget changes or does some activity on interaction with the user then it is a stateful widget
otherwise it is a stateless widget.

# my_personal_card

This is an app created with the help of stateless widget,
All it does is display the information about a user such as- his email, phone number, name, picture,etc.


I have also used 2 custom fonts which i have imported them from https://fonts.google.com/
